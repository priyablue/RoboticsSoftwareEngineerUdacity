# Project 1: Build My World

This is Project 1 of the [Udacity Robotics Software Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/robotics-software-engineer--nd209 "Robotics Course") Course 

## Project Description

In this project you will create a simulation world for all your projects used in the Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Program

1. Building a single floor wall structure using the **Building Editor** tool in Gazebo. Apply at least one feature, one color, 
and optionally one texture to your structure. Make sure there's enough space between the walls for a robot to navigate.
2. Model any object of your choice using the **Model Editor** tool in Gazebo. Your model links should be connected with joints.
3. Import your structure and two instances of your model inside an empty **Gazebo World**.
4. Import at least one model from the **Gazebo online library** and implement it in your existing Gazebo world.
5. Write a C++ **World Plugin** to interact with your world. Your code should display “Welcome to ’s World!” message as soon as 
you launch the Gazebo world file.
